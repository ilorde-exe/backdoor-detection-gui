# Malware Detection GUI Program

## Overview
This Signature-Based Malware Detection Program is designed to detect known malware by comparing file hashes against a database of known malware signatures provided in `hashes.txt`. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Files
- **LICENSE**: The license file for the program.
- **README.md**: This file providing information about the program.
- **algorithms.py**: Contains the algorithms used for signature matching.
- **gui_win_en.py**: The main Python file for the GUI interface (English version).
- **gui_win_en.spec**: A specification file for building the GUI on Windows.
- **hashes.txt**: A text file containing known malware signatures.
- **requirements.txt**: Specifies the Python dependencies required to run the program.
- **tempCodeRunnerFile.py**: Temporary file, not essential for the program.
- **winapi.py**: File containing Windows API functions for interacting with the operating system.

## Installation and Usage
To run the program, follow these steps:
1. Install the required dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` by running:
   """pip install -r requirements.txt"""

2. Execute the main Python file `gui_win_en.py` using Python:

python gui_win_en.py

3. The GUI interface will be launched, allowing you to interact with the program.
